# AI-Based Medical Diagnosis 🏥🤖  

## Overview  
This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** for **automated medical diagnosis**. It analyzes patient symptoms, medical history, and test results to predict diseases with high accuracy, aiding doctors in faster and more precise diagnoses.  

## Features  
- 🏥 **AI-powered disease diagnosis**  
- 📊 **Symptom analysis & prediction**  
- 🔬 **Medical image classification (X-rays, MRIs, etc.)**  
- 🏆 **High accuracy using Deep Learning models**  
- 🔍 **Early detection & risk assessment**  
- 🏥 **Integration with electronic health records (EHRs)**  

## Algorithms & Technologies Used  

### **1. Machine Learning (ML) Models**  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest** – For symptom-based diagnosis.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – For medical data classification.  
- **Naïve Bayes** – For probabilistic disease prediction.  

### **2. Deep Learning (DL) Models**  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** – For medical image diagnosis (X-ray, MRI, CT scans).  
- **RNN & LSTMs** – For analyzing sequential patient data.  

### **3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- Used for **Electronic Health Records (EHRs) processing** and **symptom analysis** from doctor’s notes.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas
